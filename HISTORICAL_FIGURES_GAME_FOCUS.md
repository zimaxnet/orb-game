## ðŸŽ­ **Story Generation Approach**

### **First-Person Narratives**
Each story is told from the perspective of the historical figure themselves, creating an immersive experience:

```
"Hello, I am Archimedes. Let me share with you the moment I discovered the principle of buoyancy while taking a bath..."
```

### **Educational Focus**
Stories emphasize:
- **Personal Journey**: The figure's path to their discoveries
- **Historical Context**: The world they lived in and challenges they faced
- **Impact**: How their contributions shaped the future
- **Human Element**: Their personality, struggles, and triumphs

### **Sophisticated Prompt System**
Stories use the advanced prompt management system with:
- **Category-Specific Prompts**: Tailored for Technology, Science, Art, etc.
- **Epoch-Appropriate Language**: Ancient, Medieval, Industrial, Modern, Future
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Spanish with cultural sensitivity
