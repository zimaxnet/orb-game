# üë§ Historical Figures Usage in Orb Game

## üìã Overview

Historical figures are a core component of the Orb Game's educational and engaging content strategy. The game uses **120 carefully selected historical figures** across **8 categories** and **5 epochs** to create rich, educational stories that bring history to life through AI-generated narratives.

---

## üéØ How Historical Figures Are Used

### **1. Data Structure**

Historical figures are stored in `OrbGameInfluentialPeopleSeeds` with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  "Category": {
    "Epoch": [
      {
        "name": "Historical Figure Name",
        "context": "Brief description of their achievements and significance"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **2. Story Generation Process**

When generating stories about historical figures, the system:

1. **Retrieves the figure's data** from `OrbGameInfluentialPeopleSeeds`
2. **Uses sophisticated prompts** from the prompt management system
3. **Generates personalized stories** about their achievements
4. **Creates TTS audio** for immersive narration
5. **Stores in MongoDB** for instant retrieval

**Example Story Generation:**
```javascript
// In scripts/prepopulate-all-stories.js
if (historicalFigure) {
  const basePrompt = promptManager.getFrontendPrompt(category, epoch, language, 'o4-mini');
  prompt = `${basePrompt} Focus specifically on ${historicalFigure.name} and their remarkable achievements 
            in ${category.toLowerCase()} during ${epoch.toLowerCase()} times. ${historicalFigure.context} 
            Make it engaging, informative, and highlight their significant contributions that shaped history.`;
}
```
