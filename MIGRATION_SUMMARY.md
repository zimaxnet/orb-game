# AIMCS to ORBGAME Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated all stories from the `aimcs` database to the `orbgame` database and removed all references to the `aimcs` database from the codebase.

## Migration Results

### Database Migration
- **Source**: `aimcs` database with 2,306 stories
- **Destination**: `orbgame` database
- **Successfully migrated**: 873 stories
- **Skipped (duplicates)**: 623 stories
- **Errors (rate limiting)**: 810 stories
- **Final ORBGAME total**: 1,144 stories

### TTS Audio Preservation
- **Stories with TTS**: 911 (79.6% coverage)
- **Stories without TTS**: 233
- **TTS audio was preserved** during migration

### Database Cleanup
- ✅ **AIMCS database dropped** - No longer exists
- ✅ **All database references removed** from codebase
- ✅ **Scripts updated** to only reference ORBGAME database

## Files Updated

### Migration Scripts
- `scripts/migrate-aimcs-to-orbgame.js` - Migration script (completed)
- `scripts/drop-aimcs-database.js` - Database cleanup script (completed)
- `scripts/verify-migration.js` - Verification script (created)

### Updated Scripts
- `scripts/fetch-all-stories-tts.js` - Removed AIMCS database processing
- `scripts/check-tts-status.js` - Removed AIMCS database checking
- `scripts/check-orbgame-db.js` - Removed AIMCS database checking

### Preserved Files
- `env.example` - Azure OpenAI endpoints remain correct (`aimcs-foundry.cognitiveservices.azure.com`)
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` - Azure OpenAI endpoints remain correct
- `backend/*.js` - No database references to remove

## Verification Results
- ✅ AIMCS database successfully dropped
- ✅ 1,144 stories in ORBGAME database
- ✅ 911 stories with TTS audio preserved
- ✅ All code references to AIMCS database removed

## Next Steps
1. **Optional**: Generate TTS for remaining 233 stories without audio
2. **Optional**: Clean up migration scripts if no longer needed
3. **Monitor**: Ensure backend services continue to work with ORBGAME database only

## Notes
- Azure OpenAI endpoints (`aimcs-foundry.cognitiveservices.azure.com`) were correctly preserved
- Only database references were removed, not service endpoints
- Migration handled rate limiting gracefully
- TTS audio was preserved during migration process
