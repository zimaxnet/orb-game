## ü§ñ **AI Model Parameter Requirements**

### **Critical: Model-Specific API Parameters**

Different AI models have different parameter requirements. This is crucial for successful deployment:

#### **O4-Mini Model (Azure OpenAI)**
- ‚úÖ **Required**: `max_completion_tokens` (not `max_tokens`)
- ‚ùå **Not Supported**: `temperature` parameter (only default value 1 is supported)
- ‚úÖ **Required**: `Authorization: Bearer` header (not `api-key`)
- ‚úÖ **Optimal Token Limit**: 1000 tokens for complete JSON responses

**Correct O4-Mini Request:**
```json
{
  "model": "o4-mini",
  "messages": [...],
  "max_completion_tokens": 1000
}
```

#### **GPT-4o-Mini-TTS Model (Azure OpenAI TTS)**
- ‚úÖ **Required**: Standard TTS parameters (`input`, `voice`, `response_format`)
- ‚úÖ **Required**: `Authorization: Bearer` header
- ‚úÖ **Supported**: `mp3` response format

**Correct TTS Request:**
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini-tts",
  "input": "Story text to convert to speech",
  "voice": "alloy",
  "response_format": "mp3"
}
```

#### **Other AI Models**
- **Grok 4**: Supports `max_completion_tokens` and `temperature`
- **Perplexity Sonar**: Supports `max_completion_tokens` and `temperature`

### **Common Issues and Fixes**

#### **Issue 1: Temperature Parameter Error**
**Error**: `"Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0.7 with this model"`
**Solution**: Remove `temperature` parameter from o4-mini requests

#### **Issue 2: Authorization Header Error**
**Error**: `401 PermissionDenied`
**Solution**: Use `Authorization: Bearer <key>` instead of `api-key: <key>`

#### **Issue 3: Token Parameter Error**
**Error**: `400 Bad Request` with `max_tokens`
**Solution**: Use `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`

#### **Issue 4: Incomplete JSON Responses**
**Error**: `"Unexpected end of JSON input"`
**Solution**: Increase `max_completion_tokens` to 1000 for complete responses

### **Deployment Scripts**

The rebuild script now automatically:
- ‚úÖ **Sends 100% traffic to new revisions**
- ‚úÖ **Waits for new revisions to be ready**
- ‚úÖ **Verifies traffic is redirected correctly**
- ‚úÖ **Handles single revision mode properly**

```bash
# Rebuild and deploy with traffic management
./scripts/rebuild-backend.sh
```

#### Testing the AI Model Generation System
```bash
# Test all AI models and categories
node scripts/test-ai-models.js

# Test all categories to ensure they have content
node scripts/test-positive-news-fallback.js

# Backfill all topics with o4-mini content
node scripts/backfill-topics.js

# Test individual category (legacy)
curl https://your-backend-url/api/orb/positive-news/Technology

# Test fresh AI generation
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url/api/orb/generate-news/Technology \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"category":"Technology","epoch":"Modern","model":"grok-4","count":3}'
```

#### Comprehensive Backend Testing Suite
```bash
# Run complete backend test suite
node scripts/test-new-backend.js

# Test MongoDB caching system
node scripts/test-story-cache-comprehensive.js

# Validate token usage savings
node scripts/test-token-savings.js

# Quick backend summary test
node scripts/backend-summary-test.js

# Performance comparison
node scripts/performance-comparison.js
```

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ **100% Success Rate**: All tests passing
- ‚úÖ **88.2% Performance Improvement**: Cached vs uncached requests
- ‚úÖ **29.0% Token Savings**: Per cached request
- ‚úÖ **50% Cache Hit Rate**: In test scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Language Support**: English and Spanish
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Model Support**: All AI models validated

#### How It Works
- **ü§ñ Multi-Model Selection**: Users can choose between Grok 4, Perplexity Sonar, and O4-Mini for story generation
- **üîÑ Fresh Generation**: Always generates fresh stories from selected AI models via POST requests to `/api/orb/generate-news/:category`
- **üìö Story Catalogue**: Builds a catalogue of 5 stories per session for rich content exploration
- **üéØ Epoch-Specific Prompts**: Custom prompts for Ancient, Medieval, Industrial, Modern, and Future epochs
- **‚ö° Progress Indicators**: Real-time progress bars and dynamic loading messages during generation
- **üîÑ Intelligent Fallback**: If no stories exist, automatically generates new content from the selected AI model
- **üéµ Audio Integration**: Automatic TTS generation and playback for immersive experience
- **Service Resilience**: If any AI model is unavailable, falls back to alternative models or generates content directly
- **Guaranteed Content**: All categories always have content, ensuring a smooth user experience
- **Legacy Support**: Still supports cached stories via `/api/orb/positive-news/:category` for backward compatibility

### Data Storage
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database for memories and user profiles
- **Memory Analytics**: Aggregated conversation data and trending topics
- **Real-time Caching**: In-memory analytics cache for instant responses

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Configuration

Before deploying the backend, you must set the `MONGO_URI` environment variable in your terminal. This is required for the backend to connect to your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB database.

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:MONGO_URI="<YOUR_AZURE_COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

**Bash/Zsh:**
```bash
export MONGO_URI="<YOUR_AZURE_COSMOS_DB_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

Replace `<YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING>` with your actual connection string from the Atlas portal. The deployment scripts use this variable to configure the Azure Container App. If this variable is not set, the backend will fail to connect to the database.

### Adding New AI Models
See [ADD_NEW_AI_MODEL_PROCEDURE.md](ADD_NEW_AI_MODEL_PROCEDURE.md) for a detailed guide on adding new AI models, including updating the selection list, prepopulating stories, and Key Vault integration.

### Azure Key Vault Configuration (RBAC)
The backend uses Azure Key Vault with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for secure secret management:

1. **Key Vault Setup**: The Key Vault `orb-game-kv-eastus2` uses RBAC instead of access policies
2. **Container App Permissions**: The container app's managed identity has "Key Vault Secrets User" role
3. **Secret Management**: API keys are stored as secrets and fetched at runtime
4. **RBAC Assignment**: The container app's managed identity is granted access via:
   ```bash
   az role assignment create \
     --assignee <container-app-managed-identity-id> \
     --role "Key Vault Secrets User" \
     --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<key-vault-name>"
   ```

**Note**: If you encounter Key Vault access issues, verify the RBAC role assignment is correct and the container app's managed identity has the necessary permissions.

# Deployment fix applied

## MongoDB Connection & Environment Helpers

The project now includes scripts to verify your Atlas connection locally and propagate the same connection string to CI/CD and Azure:

1. **Configure `.env`**
   
   Put your connection string in the root `.env` file:
   
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://<account-name>:<primary-key>@<account-name>.mongo.cosmos.azure.com:10255/?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb&retrywrites=false&maxIdleTimeMS=120000&appName=@<account-name>@
   ```

2. **Local connectivity test**
   
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./test-mongodb.sh   # runs scripts/test-mongodb.mjs
   ```
   You should see green *Ping successful* messages. If authentication fails, fix the user/password in Atlas or whitelist your IP.

3. **Propagate to GitHub Secrets & Azure**
   
   After the URI works locally, push it to both GitHub Actions and the Azure Container App with one command:
   
   ```bash
   scripts/update-mongo-env.sh
   ```
   Requirements:
   * `gh` CLI logged-in (`gh auth login`)
   * `az` CLI logged-in (`az login`)

   The default resource-group and container-app names are set at the top of the script; adjust if your Azure names differ.

These helpers ensure the same `MONGO_URI` is used locally, in CI pipelines, and at runtime in Azure.  
Happy hacking!
