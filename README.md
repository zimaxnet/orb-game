## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **ChatInterface**: Main chat interface with memory integration
- **ControlPanel**: Analytics dashboard and system controls
- **MemoryPanel**: Memory browsing and conversation management
- **OrbGame**: Interactive 3D gaming experience with positive news integration
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with smooth animations and touch interactions

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4o-mini for chat, TTS for audio
- **Memory Service**: MongoDB Atlas for persistent conversation storage
- **Positive News Service**: Fetches and stores positive news by category from Perplexity Sonar, caches in MongoDB, and pre-generates TTS audio for instant response
- **Analytics Caching**: Preloaded memory data for instant analytics
- **Web Search**: Perplexity API for real-time information
- **Container Deployment**: Azure Container Apps with auto-scaling

### Positive News System (Backend)
- **Source**: Perplexity Sonar API (every 15 minutes, per category)
- **Fallback**: o4-mini generates content when Perplexity API is unavailable or no stories exist
- **Storage**: MongoDB collection `positive_news_stories`
- **Serving**: Fast, cached, random story per category (cycles through if no new news)
- **TTS**: Pre-generated using Azure OpenAI TTS, returned as base64 mp3
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/orb/positive-news/:category` (GET)
- **Categories**: Technology, Science, Art, Nature, Sports, Music, Space, Innovation, Health, Education
- **Reliability**: Ensures all categories always have content, even when external APIs fail

#### Example API Usage

```
GET https://api.orbgame.us/api/orb/positive-news/Technology
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "headline": "AI Helps Doctors Diagnose Faster",
  "summary": "A new AI system is helping doctors diagnose diseases more quickly and accurately.",
  "fullText": "Researchers have developed an AI tool that assists doctors in diagnosing complex diseases, reducing errors and improving patient outcomes.",
  "source": "Perplexity Sonar",
  "publishedAt": "2024-07-17T12:00:00Z",
  "ttsAudio": "<base64 mp3>"
}
```

#### Required Environment Variables (Backend)
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: Perplexity Sonar API key
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: Azure OpenAI endpoint
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Azure OpenAI API key
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`: Azure OpenAI deployment name (for fallback content generation)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_TTS_DEPLOYMENT`: Azure OpenAI TTS deployment name

#### Testing the Fallback System
```bash
# Test all categories to ensure they have content
node scripts/test-positive-news-fallback.js

# Backfill all topics with o4-mini content
node scripts/backfill-topics.js

# Test individual category
curl https://your-backend-url/api/orb/positive-news/Technology
```

#### How It Works
- Every 15 minutes, the backend fetches the latest positive news for each category from Perplexity Sonar
- New stories are added to MongoDB; if no new stories, cycles through existing ones
- **Fallback System**: If no stories exist for a category, o4-mini generates positive content automatically
- **Service Resilience**: If Perplexity API is unavailable, the system generates content directly using Azure OpenAI
- TTS audio is pre-generated and stored with each story (including fallback content)
- When a user requests a story, a random (fresh) story is served instantly with text and audio
- **Guaranteed Content**: All categories always have content, ensuring a smooth user experience

### Data Storage
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database for memories and user profiles
- **Memory Analytics**: Aggregated conversation data and trending topics
- **Real-time Caching**: In-memory analytics cache for instant responses

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Configuration

Before deploying the backend, you must set the `MONGO_URI` environment variable in your terminal. This is required for the backend to connect to your MongoDB Atlas database.

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:MONGO_URI="<YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

**Bash/Zsh:**
```bash
export MONGO_URI="<YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```

Replace `<YOUR_MONGODB_ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING>` with your actual connection string from the Atlas portal. The deployment scripts use this variable to configure the Azure Container App. If this variable is not set, the backend will fail to connect to the database.

# Deployment fix applied

## MongoDB Connection & Environment Helpers

The project now includes scripts to verify your Atlas connection locally and propagate the same connection string to CI/CD and Azure:

1. **Configure `.env`**
   
   Put your connection string in the root `.env` file:
   
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@aimcs-cluster.rpcaamg.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

2. **Local connectivity test**
   
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./test-mongodb.sh   # runs scripts/test-mongodb.mjs
   ```
   You should see green *Ping successful* messages. If authentication fails, fix the user/password in Atlas or whitelist your IP.

3. **Propagate to GitHub Secrets & Azure**
   
   After the URI works locally, push it to both GitHub Actions and the Azure Container App with one command:
   
   ```bash
   scripts/update-mongo-env.sh
   ```
   Requirements:
   * `gh` CLI logged-in (`gh auth login`)
   * `az` CLI logged-in (`az login`)

   The default resource-group and container-app names are set at the top of the script; adjust if your Azure names differ.

These helpers ensure the same `MONGO_URI` is used locally, in CI pipelines, and at runtime in Azure.  
Happy hacking!
